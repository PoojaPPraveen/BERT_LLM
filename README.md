# BERT Language Model Implementation

This project implements BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for a language modeling task using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Setup
pip install flask transformers torch pandas
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You should see a web page where you can input text and get sentiment analysis results using BERT.

This project sets up a real-time sentiment analysis application with a web interface powered by Flask and BERT. You can expand this project further by adding more functionalities and improving the user interface.



1. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Prepare your training and testing data in the `data/` directory:
    - `data/train.txt`
    - `data/test.txt`

## Running the Code

1. Train the model:
    ```sh
    python bert_llm.py
    ```

2. Evaluate the model:
    ```sh
    python bert_llm.py
    ```

## Project Structure

- `bert_llm.py`: Main script for training and evaluating the BERT model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: This readme file.
- `data/`: Directory containing training and testing data.
